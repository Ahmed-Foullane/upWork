## Model (M) represents the application’s data and business logic.
## Which means it’s responsible for retrieving, manipulating, and storing data.

## View (V) acts as the presentation layer, which is responsible
## for presenting the data to the end user.

## Controller (C) is an intermediary between the Model and the View.
## It receives user input and determines which Model or Models
## to invoke and which View to present.
